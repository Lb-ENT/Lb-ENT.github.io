## Data-User Handling Policy

**Effective Date:** December 12, 2024

This Data-User Handling Policy supplements our Privacy Policy (located in a separate file) by outlining how Loverboy Enterprise handles user data after a deletion request is received.

**Data Retention Periods**

While we strive to fulfill user deletion requests promptly, certain circumstances may require us to retain data for a limited time after a request is submitted:

* **Legal Requirements:** We may be obligated to retain data for legal or regulatory reasons. This includes complying with law enforcement requests or preserving evidence for potential legal disputes.
* **Security Purposes:** If we detect suspicious activity associated with a user's IP address, we may retain certain data related to that activity for investigation and security purposes. This data may include timestamps, login attempts, and access logs.
* **Technical Considerations:** Complete data deletion may require additional processing steps or involve backups that are periodically overwritten.  We may retain a user's data for a short period (typically less than a week) after a deletion request to ensure complete removal and avoid accidental data recovery.

**Suspicious Activity**

Loverboy Enterprise prioritizes user security. If we detect suspicious activity associated with a user's IP address, such as multiple failed login attempts, potential malware infections, or attempts to access unauthorized resources, we may retain certain data related to that activity for investigation and security purposes. This data may include:

* IP address timestamps
* Login attempts (successful and failed)
* Accessed resources and attempted access to unauthorized resources

We will only retain this data for as long as necessary to investigate the suspicious activity and ensure the security of our Services.

**User Communication**

We will make reasonable efforts to communicate with users regarding data retention after a deletion request is received. This communication may be through email notifications or within the Services themselves.

**Your Rights**

If you have any questions or concerns about our data retention policies, please refer to our Privacy Policy or contact us at the information provided within.
