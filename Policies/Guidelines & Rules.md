## Guidelines & Rules

**Welcome to Loverboy Enterprise!**

These Guidelines & Rules outline the expectations for respectful and productive use of our Services. By accessing or using our platforms, you agree to abide by these guidelines and the accompanying Terms of Service (separate document).  

**General Principles**

* **Be respectful:** Treat others with courtesy and avoid offensive language or behavior.
* **Be honest:** Do not engage in misleading or deceptive activities.
* **Be responsible:** Use the Services for legitimate purposes and avoid causing harm to others.
* **Be mindful:** Respect intellectual property rights and avoid sharing content that is not yours to distribute.

**Enterprise Rules**

* **I. Report offensive, illegal, or hateful content:** Our content is made by staff, but we do not specifically moderate everything our staff say.
* **II. Do not share your account:** We do not allow anyone to share their account or account information to others for multi-persons use.
* **III. Users must be atleast 14:** All persons with an account must be atleast 14 years of age or older, this is to make sure our userbase is mature.
* **IV. Userbase Content:** While we have very limited public content posting, any content posted by anyone must meet our [Content Policy](#Content Policy.md).
    **IVa. Content Moderation:** We use a percentage scale for our moderation, depending on the percentile your account is on, is what you're limited to. See our [Percentiles](/Percentiles) 
     information if you have questions (it will likely answer your questions).
* **V. Copyright and Intellectual Laws:** We are compliant with Intellectual law, we require all persons using our software to respect Copyright, Trademark, Patents, and/or Trade Secrets. Infringement of any of these Intellectual properties will result in a termination of your account, service, and any other user subscriptions, messages, and information. Certain information will be held for up to 2 weeks after termination. This is held up by our Data Retention Policies found on our [Policies](Policies/) page. **Data Removal Requests will not shorten this removal period by any amount of time unless enforced by legal authority.**

**Enterprise Information Regarding [ER](#Enterprise Rules)**

Our Appeals System is very unforgiving and by using our software and/or accessing our website you agree to our terms. This includes our right to only revert punishments if they meet one of the following reasons:

* **Accidental Punishment:** Sometimes our system detects an issue that isn't really there, for example, it may think you're using our service without the rights to it (even if you do). If this happens, you can appeal **with proof** and we will revert the punishment. There is a 1 week grace period after this for one of the same. Which means, if you were terminated for "Using the Service Illegally or Unethically" and you weren't, and it's just our system acting up, you will be in a grace period from that for 7 days, and ends at 12am of the 8th day. The Executive Team has final say and can remove your grace period for any one reason.
* **Wrongful Punishment:** Assuming we ("Us", "We", "Our") wrongfully suspend or terminate your account, subscription, or access of software or website access, you will be compensated to a revert and 24 hour grace period from one of the same consequence. This does not mean you cannot get terminated for something else. It also doesn't mean Executives of Loverboy Enterprise can't suspend or terminate your account. The Executive Team has final say.

**Consequences of Violating Guidelines**

Failure to comply with these Guidelines & Rules may result in consequences, including:

* Removal of content
* Account suspension or termination
* Reporting to law enforcement (in extreme cases)

**Reporting Violations**

If you encounter any behavior that violates these Guidelines & Rules, please report it to us through the appropriate channels within the Services (if available) or by contacting us directly.

**Thank you for helping to create a positive and productive community!**
