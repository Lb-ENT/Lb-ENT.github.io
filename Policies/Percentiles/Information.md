## Percentiles Punishment Information

**Loverboy Enterprise Note:**
Our Percentiles system is not absolutely fool-proof, nor is it 100% accurate. However, it is built in such a way that if you meet a certain percentile, you will automatically be put into a punishment.
The only exception is the 100th percentile, in this stage you cannot be automatically punished by our system, but your account will be put into a *Limited Stage* where you cannot do anything, your
account will still exist but you cannot login to your account and you will be logged out as well. An executive will then take a look at your account. Previous punishents, account status, profile information, and much more.

**How Percentiles Change**

Your percentile can fluctuate based on your actions on our platform. Here's what can affect your percentile:

* **Positive Actions:** Responsible use and adherence to our guidelines can decrease your percentile.
* **Violations:** Violations of our guidelines, depending on severity, can increase your percentile.
* **Appeals:**  Successful appeals of wrongful punishments can decrease your percentile.

**Important Notes:**

* The specific actions that affect your percentile are confidential. We focus on encouraging positive behavior rather than disclosing individual triggers.
* Percentiles are constantly updated based on user activity.
* This system is designed to promote responsible use and a safe environment for everyone.
