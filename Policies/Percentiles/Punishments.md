  Your services, software access, subscription, website access, and anything related to your Internet Protocol will be terminated per the guidelines. This is permanent unless reverted within a month.
+ 100th Percentile | Total Termination™:
  We retain some of your information for Total Termination, even if removed by request, during Total Termination (which is only possible by an executive), your Internet Protocol, User-Agent, and Device MAC is completely blocked by our system. You will not be able to use our service, software, or website at all at anytime. Because of the nature of this consequence, it is non-appealable for any reason.

**Please note Total Termination™ is only used for extreme circumstances. It usually is used for Child Pornagraphy, Child Endangerment, or any other Child-endangering or extremely insensetive cases. It usually is a placeholder for forwarding your information to Legal Authority, but by law we often times are required to forward all retained information to First Responders.**
